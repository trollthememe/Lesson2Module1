#Task 1: Grocery Store Math Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? Prices don't need to be realistic!

eggs = 14.00
butter = 8.49
steak = 41.24

total = eggs + butter + steak
print(total)



#Task 2: Bank Interest If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after a year. So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that would tell us the amount at the end of the year. For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.

initial_amount = 5000
interest_rate = .09

total= initial_amount + (initial_amount * interest_rate)
print(total)
